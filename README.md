# alpha-spectroscopy-fitting-Project-Athena
Automated peak fitting algorithm for alpha spectroscopy, built in Python for high-precision parameter estimation. Uses Voigt profiles, MLE, and nonlinear least squares to handle overlapping peaks and noise in Sri Lankan samples. Targets &lt;5% error, >50% faster than manual methods for nuclear physics and monitoring.
