# Automated Peak Fitting for Alpha Spectroscopy

This repository contains a Python-based algorithm for automated peak fitting in alpha spectroscopy, designed for high-precision parameter estimation in complex spectra (e.g., Sri Lankan soil/mineral samples). The project is part of a BSc. Honours thesis at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, supervised by Dr. S. Kandeepan and Dr. Manuja Lamabadusuriya.

## Objectives
- Develop an automated algorithm for fitting Voigt-shaped peaks with <5% error.
- Handle overlapping peaks, Poisson/non-Poisson noise, and background contributions.
- Validate with synthetic and real alpha spectra.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
